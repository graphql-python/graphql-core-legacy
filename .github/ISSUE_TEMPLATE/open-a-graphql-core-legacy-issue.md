# Questions regarding how to use GraphQL

If you have a question on how to use GraphQL, please [post it to Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask?tags=graphql) with the tag [#graphql](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/graphql).

# Reporting issues with GraphQL-core 2 (legacy version)

Before filing a new issue, make sure an issue for your problem doesn't already exist and that this is not an issue that should be filed against a different repository (see below).

Please note that GraphQL-core 2 is not under active development any more, therefore we only accept bug reports or requests for minor changes that do not break compatibility. Please do not suggest new features or anything that requires greater changes. These can be suggested in the issue tracker of the current version (see below), or as a GraphQL.js or GraphQL specification issue.

The best way to get a bug fixed is to provide a _pull request_ with a simplified failing test case (or better yet, include a fix).

# Reporting issues with GraphQL-core 3 (current version)

Please use the issue tracker of the [current repository](https://github.com/graphql-python/graphql-core) for issues with current versions of GraphQL-core.
